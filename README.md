Learning PyGame

First upload:
  This was the first few lessons of getting an object to move in a basic way, and closing the game or crashing.
  I found it quite interesting, the "course" I'm following is on youtube by sentdex, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wN1jnY1PZEo&feature=youtu.be
 
Second upload:
  This concludes the game making process, in it's simple form at least, still quite a bit to learn.
  There are some things that can be improve and changed and will be at some point, glad I learned some pygame skills.
